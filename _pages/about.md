Hi there, my name is Guyuan (Gavin). My current research centers on **3D computer vision**, especially in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (**SLAM**), under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/zhpcui/'>Zhaopeng Cui</a> in the **ZJU 3D Vision Group**, **State Key Lab of CAD & CG**. I obtained my M.Eng degree from <a href='https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/'>Zhejiang University</a>. Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from <a href='https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/'>South China University of Technology</a> in 2021.
