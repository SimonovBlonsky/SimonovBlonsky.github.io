I currently work as a research assistant in **State Key Lab of CAD & CG**, College of Computer Science and Technology, **Zhejiang University**, under supervision of Zhaopeng Cui.

I obtained my ME degree of civil engineering in Zhejiang University in 2024, and Bachelor degree of construction management in South China University of Technology in 2021.

My current research centers on **Robotics** and **Navigation**, especially in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (**SLAM**), Visual-Inertial Odometry (**VIO**) and **Learning-based** odometries. Also, I have involved in several projects about signal processing, point cloud machine learning and 3D gaussian splatting.
